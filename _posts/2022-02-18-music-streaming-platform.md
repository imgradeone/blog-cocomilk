While listening to music is part of my life, I always thought that something got wrong today. As some platforms shift their focus on social things, listening becomes more and more weird. Previously, I mostly use NetEase CloudMusic, while CloudMusic provides more music that I like. Sometimes I found myself sliding on the comments for long time, while music was playing in the background, and just then I suddenly noticed that I didn't really enjoy the music itself.

Since then, I tried Spotify and fell in love with it. It feels like you get freedom to listen more music as you like, for literally free.

I'd like to share my experience on some music streaming platforms, and give you some idea to help you choose the best.

## How I Judge Them

For my personal rate, I will simply judge these platforms in these aspects:

- Music Library (or Copyright)
- Audio Quality
- User Interface
- Experience
- Cross-Platform Support
- Features (focusing on Music)

All aspects will get a special rate (from the best to the worst):

- Literally the Best
- Awesome / Comfortable
- Not So Good but Still Okay
- It Only "Just Works"
- Simply Horrible
- Why on Earth Does It Exist?!

Also, pre-built Last.fm integration will be an extra point.

> Note: The Music Library (or Copyright) part is based on my music taste (and also depends on my account region), so it might be different for you.

## Spotify

As I mentioned, Spotify is my currently mainly-used platform. ~~OK I like "超级敏感" by A-SOUL but it is region-limited.~~

<figure class="on-screen">
  <p><img src="/images/music-streaming-platform/spotify.png" alt="Spotify Windows Screenshot" tabindex="-1"></p>
</figure>

First of all, I should note that Spotify is a **literally free-to-listen** streaming platform. I'm not joking. Everything you need to do is simply sign up an **free** account (in [avaliable regions](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/where-spotify-is-available/), or you will get a "not available" page), then start your music trip with [Spotify App](https://www.spotify.com/download/) or [Web Player](https://open.spotify.com). You're all set. No credit card needed.

You can go straight on millions of songs, and I can promise that no matter what kind of music you like, everything you wanted is (almost?) avaliable on Spotify.

And, again, for FREE. This includes Jay Chou, as Chinese music streaming platform forced you to get Premium to listen his song. Yes, no more VIP-Only! You can directly stream the full song.

Spotify also provides (as far as I know) the best kind of personal recommendation. Every day you will get up to 6 Daily Mixes, based on your liked songs. Each Daily Mix provides different styles of music, but match your taste. Just start playing one of them, and discover more songs while staying with your favorites.

And, of course, Release Radar to get the latest songs from your followed artists, and Discover Weekly to get fully new taste.

Spotify also provides lyrics feature, but sometimes it doesn't work as expected.

Works on multiple devices? Then you can seamlessly connect to your other devices and control or switch the playing device, without barrier.

For Chinese music, Spotify really handled it perfectly. For example, both "Jay Chou" and "周杰伦", or "G.E.M." and "邓紫棋" works, and will be shown and translated properly, depending on your app language. It is *way* better than YouTube Music, while YouTube Music just unexpectedly translated "Zedd" into "捷德" and "Rick Astley" into "理查德·艾斯利" in Chinese UI, and this is horrible for me.

Sometimes you may meet a problem that some music is unavaliable in your region, but as for myself, this situation is rare.

Anyway, if you stay with Free account, there will be some serious limits, such as limited skip track times (6 times in an hour, only on Mobile, except some selected playlists), a bit annoying audio advertisements, unable to pick songs from most of the playlists, Connect feature might be limited, and in *some regions* there might be some listening time limit (but mostly there isn't. You may need to carefully read the [TOS](https://www.spotify.com/legal/end-user-agreement/) in your region).

Spotify provides Premium Individual for $9.99 / HK$58 per month, and all plans include 1 month free trial. (~CN￥63 / ￥48 per month)  
It is not so cheap, but to be honest, it is still worth. For a wide range of music, this could be a great home for music lovers.

> Note: Spotify Web Player is not avaliable in China. Spotify App should work as usual, even Spotify is not avaliable in China, but you'd better get Premium, as Free account only allows you to use it in a different region for 14 days. Premium allows you to travel anywhere with Spotify.

- **Music Library (or Copyright)**: Literally the Best
- **Audio Quality**: Not So Good but Still Okay
- **User Interface**: Comfortable
- **Experience**: Comfortable
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Literally the Best
- **Features (focusing on Music)**: Literally the Best
- **Last.fm Integrated**: Yes

## TIDAL

Tidal tries another way for you to enjoy music. It is different from Spotify, but it works better in audio qualities. As far as I see, it feels like Apple Music, but Tidal has some specific advantages.

<figure class="on-screen">
  <p><img src="/images/music-streaming-platform/tidal.png" alt="Tidal Windows Screenshot" tabindex="-1"></p>
</figure>

Tidal focuses on High Fidelity (HiFi) music streaming, and it provides the most astonishing quality - Master Quality. To my knowledge, only Tidal provides this kind of quality, with 2304-9216 kbps bitrate and the closest mastering sound experience. I can sincerely tell you that even though QQMusic provides Hi-Res Quality music, Tidal still got its first place.

As I didn't use Tidal for a long time, I can't provide any information about Tidal's recommendation system, but they do provide High Resolution and Bitrate Video. Take LSD's *Audio* as an example, the official MV in [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXwJHdpwtvs) provides ~3000 kbps video playback with just-work 128 kbps audio, but in [Tidal](https://tidal.com/browse/video/88721296), the video bitrate raised into 8800 kbps with (I don't know but it should be) excellent audio quality. This is even higher than 1080p High Bitrate on [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1uE411N7pa), while bilibili provides up to 6000 kbps playback (ok this Sony Music's official upload provides ~3200 kbps video playback, but 320 kbps audio).

For the music library, Tidal gets lost to Spotify, as Spotify has more music than Tidal. Take PIKASONIC as an example, on Spotify you can listen to all PIKASONIC's music, but Tidal lacks of PIKASONIC's recent music. (It might be a problem of TuneCore Japan, but it is still weird.)

However, songs from all the famous artist are avaliable on Tidal, and you can experience better audio quality than Spotify (while Spotify provides up to 320 kbps playback for Premium and 160 kbps for Free users). If you like to get information about an album or an artist, Tidal provides the detailed information for many artists and albums, with composers, lyricists and engineers for detailed songs and Wikipedia-like album information and reviews. If you previously used platforms like Xiami Music or Last.fm, it will be a tasty choice for you to play around the info. Oh yeah, the high-resolution album artwork.

If you like Chinese music, oh god, this might be a chaos. For example, Li Yugang on Tidal is splitted into 2 artists - "Li Yugang" in English and "李玉刚" in Chinese. Another way, some G.E.M.'s songs title were translated into English, while some were still in Chinese. Spotify (Hong Kong) never runs into this situation.  
So for Chinese (and Cantonese) music lovers, you might run into chaos on Tidal. But, songs are still avaliable, and they are just more difficult to discover.

Like Apple Music, Tidal is a completely paid platform, except for the US-only Free Plan. (Note that the US-only Free Plan only provides Spotify-ish 160 kbps, but Free Plan doesn't require a credit card.)

> Previously, Tidal only provides HiFi and Master qualities on the $19.99/month Tidal Legacy HiFi Plan, and 320 kbps on $9.99/month Tidal Standard, but now you can get HiFi quality on today's Tidal HiFi Plan with $9.99/month.

Tidal now provides 2 paid plans - $9.99/month HiFi Plan, with the same price of Spotify Premium Individual and better HiFi quality; and $19.99/month (~CN￥128) HiFi Plus Plan, with Master quality and directly support your favourite artist, plus Dolby Atmos and Sony 360 Reality Audio support.

In Hong Kong, Tidal HiFi is cheaper than Spotify Premium Individual, with HK$48/month (~CN￥40), and Hifi Plus with HK$96/month (~CN￥78). As Tidal (Hong Kong) lacks of some music content, but improves the quality of listening, this price is reasonable.

- **Music Library (or Copyright)**: Awesome
- **Audio Quality**: Literally the Best
- **User Interface**: Comfortable
- **Experience**: Comfortable
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Awesome (but no official Linux App)
- **Features (focusing on Music)**: Literally the Best
- **Last.fm Integrated**: Yes

## NetEase Cloud Music

NetEase Cloud Music (refer as "CloudMusic") is a fast-growing Chinese music platform, with their special community ecosystem.

~~First please ignore Wowkie Zhang / Da Zhang Wei / 大张伟 in this picture.~~

<figure class="on-screen">
  <p><img src="/images/music-streaming-platform/netease-cloudmusic.png" alt="CloudMusic Windows Screenshot" tabindex="-1"></p>
</figure>

CloudMusic introduced the comment system, and everyone can share their idea about a song, an album, or just simply ~~(get out of topic)~~ share his/her story (maybe copy?). But, "NetEmo" ("网抑云") is not a joke. As comments on CloudMusic today less focus on music itself, many users have sent lots of depress comments. Of course CloudMusic allows you to sent a "virtual hug" to these commentors, but the comments is still out of topic, no matter how popular the song is.

For the mobile app, CloudMusic may doesn't seem like an music app. Instead, the mobile app included some less-related-to-music features, such as Karaoke, livestream, and Mlog (something like Tweets with music). And yes, a lot of advertisements (only on some interface, while you're not a VIP, so it's still acceptable).

Truly, you can make some online friends on this community, but it seems like they doesn't care about the music itself.

Anyway, CloudMusic works comfortable in my computer, with less weird features and more music focusing.

While CloudMusic provides up to 320 kbps playback for free users (in a few songs, as today more songs only provides 128 kbps for free, but some 320 kbps might be fake), and it provides "SQ" or Loseless (~1200 kbps) FLAC audio for VIP users, it still lacks on the music copyright.

Although NetEase tried the best to get more content copyrights, they still focus more on independent Chinese music creator. and because of that, you can listen to lots of music by many independent artists, but songs by some famous artist are still unavaliable on CloudMusic today, including Jay Chou and TFBOYS. But it is not always a bad news, as music resources on CloudMusic can be better used. (Meanwhile, Bandcamp allows listeners to directly support independent artists with free full-song preview.)

Some famous independent works are also released to some global platforms like Spotify, for example, "接个吻，开一枪"'s "失眠飞行" (*Insomnia Flight*) is avaliable on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/4YnIDovoMJziwjW8oZZesQ?si=99950694e720405f) and [Tidal](https://tidal.com/browse/track/170592338) as well, with copyright by "网易音乐人" (NetEase Musician). ~~(but not on QQMusic lol)~~

However, while NetEase Musician introduced a lot of original works, CloudMusic still allows users to upload songs (just feels like SoundCloud xd). And... Sometimes your favourite music might suddenly becomes unavaliable... Uh, I'm out of topic.

Similar to some other Chinese music streaming platform, some songs in CloudMusic is limited to VIP users, and that means you'd better pay for the VIP to get fully access to the music library. But, some special digital albums are **forced** to be paid to listen, with little-to-no preview.

<figure class="card" markdown="1">
![Forced Paid Album](/images/music-streaming-platform/cloudmusic/paid-album.png)

<figcaption>Some album is forced to be paid in order to listen</figcaption>
</figure>

After your paid for a single song or an album, you can get access to this song/album forever (as long as it's avaliable) and download it in no-encrypt MP3/FLAC format, while some unpaid VIP-only downloads are only avaliable in encrypted NCM format. (The NCM format is similar to Spotify's encrypted OGG format provided by offline feature.)

For listening? CloudMusic is not as pure as Spotify, but it works as expected, and pretty enjoyable.

<figure class="on-screen">
  <p><img src="/images/music-streaming-platform/cloudmusic/legacy-uwp.png" alt="CloudMusic Windows UWP Screenshot" tabindex="-1"></p>
</figure>

To be noted, CloudMusic previously developed a handy UWP client, with smooth experience and excellent Windows integration, but NetEase now dropped its support, and if you download their ["UWP" client](https://www.microsoft.com/zh-cn/p/网易云音乐uwp/9nblggh6g0jf), it will turn into a regular Win32 version. (just look back on previous picture, not this picture above!)

For the price, while CloudMusic is a Freemium platform, they provide 2 different kinds of Premium: Vinyl VIP ("黑胶VIP") 

- **Music Library (or Copyright)**: It Only "Just Works"
- **Audio Quality**: Not So Good but Still Okay
- **User Interface**: Comfortable
- **Experience**: It Only "Just Works" (but with some options you can get it to "Awesome")
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Not So Good but Still Okay
- **Features (focusing on Music)**: Not So Good but Still Okay
- **Last.fm Integrated**: No (3rd-party software/extension needed)

## Apple Music (China)

## QQMusic

> As Kugou Music and Kuwo Music are all under the [Tencent Music Entertainment Group](https://www.tencentmusic.com/), and their user experience is far worse than QQMusic, so I will simply ignore them.
