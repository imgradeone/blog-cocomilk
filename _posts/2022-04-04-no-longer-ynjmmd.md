> "I have to make this reform for myself, not only to my misleading legacy, but also to my future of independant content creation."

This article was originally written on my notebook on March, and to be honest, a lot of details have been changed now, since I started to drop my current Chinese identity "一年级么么哒" on Bilibili from April 1st. Obviously, the change goes on now, and I'll gradually drop this identity on all social media platforms.

Even though the legacy Chinese identity "一年级么么哒" has been used for around 7 years, it had left a long-term, but strange and tough legacy. I should declare that while I firstly used this identity on Weibo in 2015, I made tons of weird mistakes (as I was still a little boy), and recently (yet a few months ago) when I blocked some annoying users on Bilibili, I received lots of spams, swear, and bully from groups of children users.

Also, my legacy Chinese identity HAD misled a lot of people (even though my English identity "imgradeone" did so, lol),
